    "## (0) Initial thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of problem is this?\n",
    "-  It can be considered supervised or not\n",
    "-  It requires deciding what data to use, finding it, preparing it and analysing it, and so this notebook will not begin with the customary initial data exploration\n",
    "-  A value is to be predicted, so it is of a regression type\n",
    "\n",
    "### What data is there?\n",
    "Raw data is \"short but wide\", with potential for engineering.\n",
    "\"Short\" because financial data goes stale quickly; Apple of 1982 is not Apple of 2018, so there's litte if anything positive to be gained by going too far back in time.\n",
    "\"Wide\" because the financial statements contain many categories of data, beyond which there are __patent status reports, industry-wide data, upstream industry data (chip sales)__ and so on.\n",
    "Of the available data, what is important? Hard to say (RFTs, GBTs will be able to tell us).\n",
    "-  __[iPhones drive sales](http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1193125-14-383437&cik=)__\n",
    "-  __[Concensus estimates](https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/forecasts?s=AAPL:NSQ)__ FY2018 sales at \\$261bn (Q3=\\$52bn, Q4=\\$59bn)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How should I select and optimise features?\n",
    "Irrelevant features should be removed to avoid misleading models; redundant features removed for computational efficiency; genuine indicators should be sought.\n",
    "-  Selection by correlation assuming linear relationships\n",
    "-  Use scikit learn's \"mutual information\" tool for more subtle relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### What models are likely to be appropriate?\n",
    "Treating annual revenues as sequential data (with other features as inputs) suggests RNN/LSTM approach, perhaps even a __[sophisticated Deep Belief Network approach](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/6/899/pdf)__ like pre-training with a Restricted Boltzman Machine then passing through a supervised process; my studies haven't gotten this far yet so this may involve studying more than time constraints allow at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the intrinsically small datasets I have in mind, ensembling over multiple approaches should help. This also suggests a Bayesian approach but I my studies have yet covered how to apply this (perhaps a prior derived from industry analysis, updated by \"data\" gathered from these models?). As long as I am using small datasets, my models will be prone to high bias, which I will account for with regularisation techniques. If I find a way to use all the NYSE data, for example, I will be able to use large tree-based models with cross-validation to detect subtle features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will mostly work with financial data (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow; share price data; economic indicators etc). This will be a structured dataset with high multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect starting basic and building up will be enlightening in a way I cannot predict, so I will aim to proceed something like as follows:\n",
    "1. Linear Regression (fast and simple so good for a quick baseline; however it will suffer due to the dataset's high multicollinearity)\n",
    "2. Random Forest (gets around redundant features and captures non-linear relationships; liquidity is likely to be non-linear at the margin, as is the impact of accumulating uninvested cash, as shareholders start to apply pressure)\n",
    "3. Gradient Boosted Trees (xgboost is built for speed and balancing variance with bias, and is famous for helping people win Kaggle competitions; it also has excellent in-built tools for hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation)\n",
    "4. RNN (sequential data)\n",
    "5. LSTM (captures cyclicality and possibly features like R&D spending or financial health in the past)\n",
    "6. DBN (I came across a research paper in which this techique solves a similar problem to this one; very subtle features are captured.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't use SVM Regression at this stage because it is quite slow compared to the added predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What might help given more resources?\n",
    "On a huge budget, satellite images of Apple store car parks and pedestrian traffic entering and exiting shops between now and the end of the financial year. Likewise, access to anonymised emails (provided by a data broker like __[Quandl](https://www.quandl.com)__) to count logs of purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more time, I would conduct __correlation analysis between performance and indicators to find which lag maximises predictive power__ - most obviously with patent features, and possibly balance sheet features. (The DBN article linked to above performed this analysis on pharmaceuticals and determined the time lag between patent features and performance to be three years.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potentially useful analysis would be to study __historic broker error__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the immediate challenges?\n",
    "-  (Q) How can I predict 2018 revenue without 2018 features?\n",
    "-  (A) By treating the year n-1 data as the features for the prediction of revenue in year n. In the case of RNN-like approaches, I could use quarterly data and make a prediction followed by a prediction based on a prediction, though this is prone to instability.\n",
    "-  (Q) What is the training/test data in this context (for methods like RF)?\n",
    "-  (A) The test set will be the single point \"2017 revenue\". To reality-check the model I could run this against __Apple's competitors__, or even use broader markets for training.\n"
